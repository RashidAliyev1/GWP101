     <p>Coffee is consumed worldwide – the industry ranges from the growth, production, and distribution. There are so many different blends, brands, and beans that it can be difficult to understand what can make each cup of coffee different from the other. A blend of coffee is the result of combining two different beans to produce different flavors and strengths. Blends are not standardized in the coffee industry, making it difficult to fully grasp the core differences between cups. In order to define a House Blend coffee, you must first understand the basic components of roasting coffee.</p>

     <p>When it comes to coffee, everyone has a particular taste. Some people like a stronger flavor, while others enjoy something light on the mouth. It is individual preference that separates one taste from another.The term “French roast” sounds like a description of dark, gleaming coffee beans originating from a French coffee plantation. However, the first half is correct, but the second part is a work of fiction. Therefore, you might be thinking, “what is French roast coffee”?</p>

      <p>Coffee is a $2.2 billion business in Columbia, and there are more than 500,000 families producing coffee within the country, each on small farms with limited acreage. There was a boon in coffee production in the early 20th century because many former migrant workers who had formerly worked for wealthy plantation owners in the past with inhumane working conditions and no form of social security, decided to start coffee farms of their own to improve their position.</p>
